# AGD Insurance Landing Page

This site uses W3 html includes. In order to work on this locally, you must use a local dev server, such as MAMP, and view it via localhost. Just previewing in a browser won't execute the includes.

You will also need a sass compiler like [Koala](http://koala-app.com/)

This site uses Boostrap.
